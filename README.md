# Independent Artist Website

## Project Summary

The objective of this project is to develop a website to generate exposure for an independent artist to the world.
A primary goal is to allow users who are interested parties to find out further information about
the artist and to directly connect with the artist.
The users will be able to view the work of the artist and relevant information about the artist
such as academic achievements, biograpghy, interests and future artistic direction.
The artist will have the opportunity to showcase their work and be able to connect with interested
parties, be they art connoisseurs, galleries, art interest groups and other artists.

## UX

I used the 5 planes of UX Design to overarch the method of design.

#### Strategy Plane

The overall aim of this project is to generate exposure for an independent artist and allow
them to connect wwith interested parties.

#### Scope Plane

The website will include a gallery of the artist's work to date, a biography of the artist
and a facility to contact the artist.

#### Structure Plane

The website will be delivered in three pages:

1. Home - tasters, testimonials, reviews, location link.
2. Portfolio - Gallery overview, images of the artist's work.
3. Contact - Form for the user to contact the artist and section with latest detail on
   exhibitions.

#### Skeleton Plane

The navigation will be intuitive based on the above groupings with each page available
using a link, i.e. "Home", "Portfolio", or "Contact", and no reliance on the "Back", button.

#### Surface Plane

Each page format will be consistent with colors and structure, e.g. social media links
in the footer of each page and nav at the top.

## Technologies Used

#### Frameworks, Tools and Libraries

- [Bootstrap Download Page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/download/) -
  I used Bootstrap to allow me to avail of some of the native classes to Bootstrap such as the grid,
  and to use Jquery and JavaScript for the toggler button on the mobile navigation.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/kits/be55c1e366/use) - I used Font Awesome to accentuate the text where appropriate.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I used Google Fonts to style the text on my site.

#### Languages

- [HTML Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - the main language to structure the elements of the page.
- [CSS Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) - used to style the elements.
- [Javascript Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - used with Jquery to allow the nav button toggler to operate.

## Testing

#### Tools

- [HTML and CSS validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - no issues found in my html files or my css file.
- [Reponsivity validator](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - all of my pages opened on all the device sizes.
- Developer tools in the browser for regular testing to ensure mobile first design was respected.

#### Functional Tests

- On the home page, there is a link for directions that should open in a new tab. I verified this.
- On the contact page, there is a form with required fields. I verified that they give a message to the user if left blank.
  Also, the email type means a user must poplulate an address with @ included which I validated. Once name, email and message
  entered, the submit button works and blanks the form out.
- The Nav bar has links to each page so that the back button is not depended upon. I tested by navigating to each page from
  every other page.
- The footer contains social media links that go to the social media home pages. I verified that each does this and opens
  in a new tab.
- Along with the automated tools, I tested the site on my own devices including mobile for responsiveness.
