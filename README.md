# Independent Artist Website

## Project Summary

The objective of this project is to develop a website to generate exposure for an independent artist to the world. 
A primary goal is to allow users who are interested parties to find out further information about
 the artist and to directly connect with the artist.
 The users will be able to view the work of the artist and relevant information about the artist 
 such as academic achievements, biograpghy, interests and future artistic direction. 
 The artist will have the opportunity to showcase their work and be able to connect with interested 
 parties, be they art connoisseurs, galleries, art interest groups and other artists. 
 
 ## UX

 I used the 5 planes of UX Design to overarch the method of design. 

#### Strategy Plane    
The overall aim of this project is to generate exposure for an independent artist and allow
    them to connect wwith interested parties.

#### Scope Plane
The website will include a gallery of the artists work to date, a biography of the artist
and a facility to contact the artist. 

#### Structure Plane
The website will be delivered in three pages:

1. Home - tasters, testimonials, reviews, location link.
2. Portfolio - Gallery overview, images of the artist's work.
3. Contact - Form for the user to contact the artist and section with latest detail on 
    exhibitions, blogs and any current point of interest. 

#### Skeleton Plane
The navigation will be intuitive based on the above groupings with each page available 
using a link, i.e. "Home", "Portfolio", or "Contact", and no reliance on the "Back", button. 

#### Surface Plane
The pages format will be  consistent with colors and structure, e.g. social media links
 in the footer of each page and nav at the top.
